## Overview

GlobeTrotter was built to solve a glaring problem in the modern travel landscape: multi-city travel planning is fragmented across chaotic notes apps, messy spreadsheets, and disconnected travel forums. Planning a complex journey should feel as exciting as the trip itself, not like a chore. GlobeTrotter unifies itinerary building, cost tracking, and destination discovery into a single, cohesive, premium experience.

Designed for both the meticulously organized planner and the spontaneous traveler, GlobeTrotter stands apart from generic trip-planning apps by rooting its experience in real data. Our itineraries are fully cost-aware, our activities catalog helps you discover what to do, and our community tab lets you browse, share, and draw inspiration from public trips planned by fellow travelers.

Backed by a powerful admin analytics engine and row-level secured database architecture, GlobeTrotter is a complete ecosystem for the modern explorer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- npm or yarn
- A Supabase account and project

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dipesh-23/GlobeTrotter-ForOdooHack.git
   cd GlobeTrotter-ForOdooHack
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Copy the example environment file and fill in your Supabase details:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Set up the Database**
   - Run the SQL migration scripts located in your Supabase SQL Editor to set up the `users`, `trips`, `trip_stops`, `cities`, `activities`, and `stop_activities` tables.
   - Seed the database with initial catalog data for cities and activities.

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | `https://xyz.supabase.co` |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Your Supabase public anonymous key | `eyJhbGci...` |

*(Note: Never commit your actual `.env` file to version control. An `.env.example` file is provided for reference.)*

## Database Schema Highlights

GlobeTrotter relies on a robust relational Postgres schema:
- **`users`**: Profiles extending Supabase Auth, storing display names and avatars.
- **`trips`**: The core trip container created by users, tracking dates and public/private status.
- **`trip_stops`**: Ordered legs of a trip linking to the `cities` catalog.
- **`activities` & `cities`**: The master catalogs shared across all users.
- **`stop_activities`**: Join table binding catalog activities to a specific trip stop, handling custom scheduling and cost overrides.

**Security:** Strict Row-Level Security (RLS) policies are enforced across all tables ensuring users can only read/write their own trips, while still allowing the Community tab to query `is_public` trips safely. The Admin Dashboard relies on an enforced backend policy to gate analytics access.

## Roadmap / Future Work

- [ ] **"Duplicate Trip" Feature**: Allow users to clone public community trips into their own workspace with one click.
- [ ] **Cross-Day Drag-and-Drop**: Refine the itinerary builder to allow dragging activities seamlessly across different days.
- [ ] **Personalized Preferences**: User-configurable idle-gap thresholds persisted to their profile.
- [ ] **By-City Budgeting**: Add a "By City" budget breakdown slice for complex multi-city trips.
